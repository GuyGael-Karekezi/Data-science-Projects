# Project 4: Life Expectancy Regression

## Overview
This project predicts life expectancy using regression models and compares their performance.

## Main Work
- Data understanding and preprocessing
- Missing value imputation and outlier handling
- Feature engineering on health and socioeconomic variables
- Regression model comparison (Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Gradient Boosting)
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV

## Project Structure
