# DIAML Projects (Fall)

This repository contains three projects completed for the **Data, Inference, and Applied Machine Learning (DIAML)** course.

## Projects

### Project 3: Loan Status Prediction (Classification)
Folder: `Project-3-Loan-Status-Prediction/`

What it covers:
- Exploratory data analysis of the **Loan Status Prediction** dataset
- Missing value analysis and outlier handling
- Feature engineering and categorical encoding
- Training and evaluating linear classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, SGD)
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix, classification metrics, and ROC/AUC

Main files:
- Notebook: `Project-3-Loan-Status-Prediction/notebooks/project3_loan_status_prediction.ipynb`
- Project README: `Project-3-Loan-Status-Prediction/README.md`

### Project 4: Life Expectancy Regression (Model Comparison + Tuning)
Folder: `Project-4-Life-Expectancy-Regression/`

What it covers:
- Data understanding and preprocessing for life expectancy data
- Missing value imputation and outlier handling
- Regression model comparison (Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Gradient Boosting)
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- Evaluation with MSE, MAE, R2, and explained variance

Main files:
- Notebook: `Project-4-Life-Expectancy-Regression/notebooks/project4_life_expectancy_regression.ipynb`
- Project README: `Project-4-Life-Expectancy-Regression/README.md`

### Project 5: Financial Time Series Analysis, PCA, and Forecasting
Folder: `Project-5-Financial-Time-Series-and-PCA/`

What it covers:
- Downloading and analyzing **DJIA stock** data
- Return/correlation analysis and PCA
- Correlation-based clustering
- Time-series diagnostics (ADF, STL, ACF/PACF)
- Forecasting comparison (SMA, ARIMA, LSTM)

Main files:
- Notebook: `Project-5-Financial-Time-Series-and-PCA/notebooks/project5_financial_time_series_pca_forecasting.ipynb`
- Project README: `Project-5-Financial-Time-Series-and-PCA/README.md`
